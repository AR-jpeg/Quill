Everything is either a type, a function call, or a method call.
This is done via operator overloading and syntatic sugar.
Variables are statically typed.
Each variable is simply a key in the map globals. It is represented by
an object of type Symbol.
For example:
a = 5
This sets the key :a (Symbol('a')) in the map globals to 5.
Using = is simply calling the method a.=. That is how operators work:
Every combination of a name (a), another name (=), and an expression simply 
calls a method.
